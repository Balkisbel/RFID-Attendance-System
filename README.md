#  RFID Attendance System

A simple Arduino-based attendance system using RFID technology to log presence. The system uses an RFID reader to scan cards and confirms actions via LED and buzzer feedback.

##  Project Objective

This project aims to provide a basic access control and attendance logging system using RFID cards. It is suitable for applications such as school attendance, office check-ins, or access control.

##  Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- RFID Reader (e.g., RC522)
- RFID Tags (13.56 MHz)
- LED (status indicator)
- Buzzer (confirmation sound)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Features

- Detects and reads RFID cards
- Identifies authorized users
- Activates LED and buzzer as feedback
- Displays access status on Serial Monitor
- Easily expandable to store attendance logs or control a door lock
